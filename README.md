# CIFAR10 Dataset Classification using Logistic Regression Classifier

The CIFAR10 dataset is a image dataset which contains different image of categories i.e. it has total of 10 classes.The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class. The image format is 32 * 32 pixel. A sample of images from the dataset is shown below.

We have developed a Logistic Regression Classifier and used grid search for best hyperparameter search. We are able to achieve an accuracy of 30% on the test set. Following graph shows the loss rate with number of epochs. We have also used K fold validation
